# User WS Challenge
This folder contains my solution to the technest challenge
## Application description
A simple REST API for to administer user accounts. The application connects to a MySQL database with a table, Users, which contains the user account information

## Execution instructions
In order to execute the application, MySQL server 8 must be running on localhost, port 3306
1. Run the sql script in the file dbScript.sql to create a sample database (with no data)
2. Open the project in the folder challenge_jmp 
3. Execute the application in the project
4. The web server will be listening on port 8085
5. The file technest-swagger.yaml provides the API documentation

## Additional notes
This application does not require authentication, since I understand it falls out of the scope of the challenge. Should authentication be required, please let me know which roles should be implemented. I will update the project and return it to you within 2 business days.
